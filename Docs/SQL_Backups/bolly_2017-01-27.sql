	(1,'Gunday',NULL,3,'For this movie, I’ll summarize it before the full review because the movie went just like its trailer. Very interesting at the start, and then terrible throughout. Gunday fascinates well in the start with good cinematography and direction. Two child actors who played young Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor picked the story line with their wonderful acting and dialogue deliveries. The First fifteen minutes enjoyment gives a good feeling where one starts expecting at least something good from the movie. But the film comes down with a huge impetus similar to a hanging criminal whose support is removed. Unfortunately, the hanging person is the viewer itself. There is an effort made on dialogues but nothing suits well when the actors grow up. I would have loved the movie to continue with the child actors and rather give last fifteen minutes to the lead actors.\n\nPriyanka Chopra fans like me will keep on searching for something good from her, but she never delivers anything here. Rather after her entry, search for any kind of story will fail. Ranveer and Arjun tried to act well but they never succeeded. At the interval, you would love to leave the dud but I gave it a chance expecting someone to pull it from the grave. The stupid climax is predictable which shouldn’t be said climax at all.\n\nSongs deepen your wound although “Tune Maari Entrian” song forces you to shake a leg for a minute. The second half gave few glimpses of pickup but all proved to be fake. I’ll applaud for Irrfan Khan as he managed to act well in this type of story flow as well, the reason I managed to complete the film alive. As far as direction is concerned, I’ll not blame it a lot and would rate it decently.\n\nOverall, this is surely avoidable and I’ll suggest a better time utilization this Valentine.',1,NULL,'2014-02-14',2014,2010,'http://cdn.bollywoodmdb.com/cover/i1/15251_gunday_cover.jpg'),
	(2,'Highway',NULL,7,'I used to be a strong believer that if a story is not strong, the movie will not be likable, be it anything. This film has certainly changed this perception. For all those (only story lovers) who hated or will hate this movie, seriously I’ll not be having any harsh feelings. It’s a very slow paced movie but keeps you attached throughout especially in the first half. It flows like a calm river without much dialogues and will tie you with amazing direction by Imtiaz Ali.\n\nBackground score is good and works well with the movie. Fewer songs are used and of course, AR Rehman’s great Patakha Guddi is one of them. The second half brings the film down as it becomes extra slow and starts haunting you. Thankfully it picks up suddenly, and after some hiccups fascinates in the end. You’ll feel a need, to watch the sky in silence without any disturbance.\n\nThere were many expectations from Alia Bhatt, and so effectively from start to end, the girl delivers a wonder performance. You start liking her from the start and she charms till the last scene. Randeep Hooda finally got a role to prove again, that he’s a good actor.\n\nExperience how a zero story wonder, show marvels with strong acting and direction.',2,NULL,'2014-02-21',2014,2010,'http://cdn.bollywoodmdb.com/cover/i1/15208_highway_cover.jpg'),
	(3,'Shaadi Ke Side Effects',NULL,3,'As understood from the title that the movie is purely based on post-marital issues with a try to introduce a witty element for the viewers. Fun to see but definitely not fun to experience. Thematically this has been shown a numerous number of times and it’s very difficult to show something unique. Similar feeling propped in the start but it kept on showing some content just before you develop a feeling of dislike. At interval somehow, the movie survives although it gives a feeling of drag. The second half from starting to end confirms that this is the one dirty drag that haunts you till you have a headache. There’s no effort made on anything and it shows up on the screen throughout the second half. It’s easily one hour extra and I’d have been happier if it would have ended in the interval itself.\n\nThere’s nothing to blame the two brilliant lead actors because they had nothing special to do in this flick. They tried what best they can do and gave their best shot possible which is definitely not enough as far as this movie is concerned.\n\nThis was just the second film after Pyaar ke side effects for Saket Chaudhary and since he was also the writer, I’ll say he didn’t bank upon the opportunity. Riding on his previous version, he almost squandered the chance. After a long time, Pritam disappointed with no chords connected with the script this time. Music was poor and added to the overall disappointment. \n\nOverall, something was tried in the concept but with no results.',3,NULL,'2014-02-28',2014,2010,'http://cdn.bollywoodmdb.com/cover/i1/15342_shaadi-ke-side-effects_cover.jpg'),
	(4,'Queen',NULL,8,'My all nerves are shouting that this is one wonderful movie but I’ll hold myself to talk about both ups and downs. The movie gives a good earlier feeling but slows down immediately for around half an hour. A very typical Indian girl who honestly follows all the rules and values in the society and living a normal decent life suddenly gets a shock which moves her life. Luckily she takes a decision to travel as planned but the movie slowness remains. I’ll say it’s all justified to build a plot to deliver an awesome treat to the viewers.\n\nKangana single-handedly manages to keep the film alive at that time. Film really takes off after the drinking scene in Paris and never seems to land thereafter. Yes, the movie has content and enough material but what makes it moving is Kangana and only Kangana. I don’t know how many times I want to say that she acted fantastically but that’s because there was not even one moment when she kept any foot wrong. Lisa Hayden played a good part to assist Kangana for some time. The second half was a bit down but again it was Kangana who kept it continuously alive. The movie has few very good light moments with nice acting by some foreign actors. Rajkummar has a little role but not impressive or of any significance.\n\nThere’s one good Shadi ka music by Amit Trivedi that reminds of his earlier ones but still suits well with the movie. Oldie Hangama hogaya is the song that puts breadth into the whole movie theme, certainly a good choice. Vikas Bahl yet again after Chillar Party brings forth a good and a sweet movie with his Direction that enhances the movie feel and acting. I’ll take nothing away from him, the way scenes are directed (or I should say Kangana is directed) and the way whole scenes are created is highly appreciable. He produces a smile to everyone’s face with his talent that includes story and screenplay.\n\nOverall I’ll say Kangana is literally a current Queen of Bollywood and the superb female lead acting that she has delivered is seen after a long time, very long time.',4,NULL,'2014-03-07',2014,2010,'http://cdn.bollywoodmdb.com/cover/i1/15144_queen_cover.jpg'),
	(5,'Bewakoofiyaan',NULL,5,'My expectations were less after the unconvincing initial cut of the movie but it didn’t disappoint. A beautiful comedy touch has been given to a good pickup story from a normal life where a couple persuades their family for love marriage. It had a very nice start and keeps you attached almost throughout the journey.  A good light hearted comedy where nothing is that great but everything is acceptable and satisfactory. I’ll give thumbs up to the dialogue writer as it suited perfectly with the whole script and was exactly according to what was expected for this type of story. The best part of the movie is its length. There’s almost no drag, no silly surprises and the movie keeps it pace correctly. Although first half is comparatively better where the second half has some slow moments, but overall it brings a smile to your face at the end.\n\nThe reason I’ve started with Rishi Kapoor’s name in the Actors list above should be clear. He stole the show from the so-called lead actors. I already had expectations from him because one of the major factors, which made me little excited to see this movie was Rishi Kapoor. Once again he rose to the expectations and delivered a fantastic performance. Be it dialogues, screen presence and whatever it is, he was charming. Ayushmann was also very good and proved his worth again. Of course, not a big star performance, but a required enamor that he delivers every time. Sonam continues to be a usual dumb actor but thankfully nowhere she spoils the show and brings forth a decent one.\n\nNupur Asthana worked on yet another light hearted comedy after Mujhse Fraaandship karoge and doesn’t disappoint at all. It’s again a modest attempt that is least expected from a director always. Hitesh Sonik’s music is not used much but mostly goes well with the movie.\n\nOverall a good comedy that is enjoyable and yet forgettable.',5,NULL,'2014-03-14',2014,2010,'http://cdn.bollywoodmdb.com/cover/i1/15705_bewakoofiyaan_cover.jpg'),
	(6,'Ragini MMS 2',NULL,2,'Ragini MMS first part was shown as a reality and this second part was an attempt to make a movie on this reality. What was tried and expected here was the story behind this haunted house, evils, and all those recurring horror themes. I often find these stories interesting even if they are above average like the ones in Vikram Bhatt movies. They at least make some sense as far as the horror logic is concerned. But this one was really atrocious. Neither anything was new nor interesting. Although not a type of movie in which one will cry waiting for the end but of a type in which one will keep on searching some content. The first half was a build up and leaves with some hope of an interesting story of haunted Patwardhan house. It looked that there are a lot of scopes to channelize on this concept and the second half will bring some excitement. But regrettably, it was full of foolishness and moreover the ending was absurd.\n\nDivya Dutta was the only actor that looked doing some acting in this revenant plot. She was the only interesting thing in the movie apart from Sunny Leone not for her acting off-course. All other supporting actors including Sandhya Mridul were pathetic although Anita Hassandani was comparatively better.\n\nDirection seemed copied from all other previous horror flicks where nothing new or firm was presented. Bhushan Patel has attempted this genre the second time after 1920 that was much better than this one. The improvement was expected from him but the reverse happened. To start with, Meet Brothers’ Baby Doll kicked off the movie well. Although not much of music was used in the movie, it again ended with a kick by Honey Singh’s vodka song.\n\nOverall a very dud flick with a revenant plot and below average acting.',6,NULL,'2014-03-21',2014,2010,'https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQtsYOAMcWDiwN3id1rT5JwhC9-EUuFCj4T_8iGY02dZRhKLltFSA'),
	(7,'Revolver Rani',NULL,3,'All expectations were high, off-course only because of Kangana’s marvelous acting in Queen. The movie was already in heart of most of the fans like me but definitely, there was a scare of this revolver flick being a dud. The movie starts with the introduction of few Chambal Dakus who irritated immensely with their poor acting and dialogues. It went like a low-grade comedy plot trying to make people laugh in foolishness. The story keeps on continuing without any meaning. Much unusual unique stuff was tried which was pleasant on very few occasions like news reading by a funny reporter and some comedy when Piyush Mishra takes on Vir Das aggressively in the second half. There were rare moments that made us thoughtful that the movie might pick up from here, otherwise it’s an effort that is seldom seen.\n\nKangana starts impressing in the casting photos itself even before her entry. She was the sole factor that makes you sit hoping for something good. Definitely, she manages to act well and no complaints as per as her effort is concerned. Piyush Mishra was yet again impressive as always and was responsible for some good moments. Vir Das was normal and could not showcase anything phenomenal.\n\nDirector Sai Kabir made all actors do something unique just for the sake of being different that didn’t go well. Also, he doesn’t have a good track record in writing that continues here.

Also that it would be just a go to sports flick. But hold on, Gupte has delivered a charismatic cinema here and proved yet again that child stories can be equally innovative every-time as adult stories can be. Right from the word go, this movie wins on all fronts. Apart from a child sports story, it shows the city dimension from street side poor children’s perspective. There’s a majestic selection of children roles, and the way they are used in the story is amazing. Solely they become the soul of the movie.\n\nClubbed with entertaining one-liners, it’s much more to a sports competition. I’d rather say it’s an artistic brilliance, making a sports story just a medium of display. Partho steals all hearts with his amazing acting, improving a lot from his earlier Stanley Ka Dabba. The way he delivers dialogs and gives expression is just phenomenal. All other supporting children were bang on in their roles. Every child showcased great talent. Not to forget Saqib Saleem who impressively does exactly what was expected from him.\n\nThe music alone can’t be judged here. The way it was blended with the superb lyrics creating a nice background wherever required in the story was amazing. All the credits above, goes to the director Amole Gupte.

There’s almost nothing meaningful in the movie as the script goes by and it feels that movie just has been made to launch the first timers. There are no strong dialogues rather it’s full of silly panti. Off-course no brains were used but the sad part was that the few skills that Tiger has, those were also not used well in filming. All these things apart, something was there in the movie that masked the irritation and the second half ties you till the movie end somehow. The ending was albeit an unnecessary drag and it finished with same few standard dialogues used throughout the movie. \n\nTiger Shroff is known for his athletic skills and it was expected that the movie will have lots of breathtaking action scenes but unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. I think Tiger should work on his dialogues and use voice dubbing for some time to start with. I feel he should have started his career in a strong villain role. Kriti Sanon was not at all bad but nowhere any promising factor was seen. I would still believe in her that given a good chance, she might have the capabilities to sail through some respectable lengths. Prakash Raj had a strong important role and he was very well up for it. Be it emotional scenes or any aggressive scenes, his contribution was amazing.\n\nSabir Khan did a below average job in the direction. Although nothing great was expected from him but I would say he could have done little better. Movie flow was below standard for a majority of the time.

Film picks up on the entry of security bureau guy who helps in Rajkummar’s recruitment as his partner guard. It was this time when you stop relaxing at your seat and genuinely expect some thrill. Little bit unrealistic in it’s approach but emphasizes on the extent a person can go for his family. \n\nAlthough movie slows yet again and I’d say luckily the climax was something that makes up for all the slowness that prevailed. It also justifies somehow the initial 2 hours but still not strong enough to make the storywriter guilt free. Rajkummar was good at his role but definitely not even close to amazing. Hansal Mehta brought out his amazing acting skills in their last venture Shahid but this was just normal. Patralekha was also decent but I’ll give maximum marks to the security bureau guard who was the best actor in this flick.

Hyderabadi style and accent are also used very nicely. The story beautifully evolves and develops in the first half with very good comedy punch lines to carry it forward. Everything just looks good and interesting enough but not extraordinary. The movie loses its sheen in the second half creating a want of a deserved good ending.

It leaves flourishing some interest in viewer’s mind in the first half and after the second half, it leaves people full of smiles and with Salman’s sensation. Salman Khan was the real star of the show after many many years. He genuinely acts well and luckily a good plot backs him. No weird scenes or dialogues on this occasion. Randeep Hooda re-lived his Shootout brilliance and was good throughout. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was the showman in the second half and his small role also left a big impact. Mithun and Jacqueline were just normal.\n\nSajid Nadiadwala jumped into Direction boots for the first time and was above average in all aspects. I’ll not take anything away from him. As a producer and director, he ensured that full justice should happen to this type of plots that generally run only on star power. At least some legitimate efforts were put this time.

Many hilarious dialogues were written with good effort and research. The sad part is that it didn’t stop the director from including silly things unnecessarily. It loses sheen very fast and gets trapped to standard foolishness. I don’t understand why this is done deliberately in these kinds of movies. I’d say it was stupid, but a little bit entertaining. The way film was executed; I’d like to see it as a series of drama episodes rather than a full-blown movie.\n\nActors didn’t have anything to do although everyone was decent in whatever was asked to do.

Farhad and Sajid are involved in the writing of such movies for a long time now.\n\nThe direction is certainly not their cup of tea, at least at this point of time.

You’ll get a feeling that you are being served a different drink in the same bottle. Although the drink tastes same but fortunately it tastes good. It has many good punches but no bad ones. Sometimes the rhythm becomes less funny but still gives a good time pass. The worst part was the ending. Very religiously they stuck to the earlier theme of having a bad ending as well. If ending would have been shortened and improvised upon, smiles would have been wider.\n\nNana Patekar, Anil Kapoor and Paresh Rawal once again picked the whole movie on their shoulders.

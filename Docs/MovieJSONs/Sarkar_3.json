  "review":"A typical Ram Gopal Varma movie which had something that was missing in his recent ventures. It gives a hint that RGV might have regained his touch to at least make a decent movie. Sarkar 3 is decently written and directed but has nothing unique or impacting.\n\nStoryline Rating: 3\n\nActing Rating: 3\nAmitabh Bachchan: 3\nYami Gautam: 2\nJackie Shroff: 2\nManoj Bajpayee: 3\nRonit Roy: 3\n\nDirection Rating: 3\n\nMusic Rating: 2\n\nCinematography: 2\n\nEditing: 2",

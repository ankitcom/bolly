  "review":"A strongly written and well-thought script that shows partition vows with a very different and unique angle. Barring the irrelevant noisiness of some characters, it's a well directed and acted movie. Vidya Balan along with other characters like Gauhar Khan, Chunky Pandey, Sumit Nijhawan and Ila Arun were brilliant.\n\nStoryline Rating: 4\n\nActing Rating: 3\nVidya Balan: 3\nGauhar Khan: 3\nChunky Pandey: 4\nSumit Nijhawan: 4\nIla Arun: 3\nNaseeruddin Shah: 3\nPallavi Sharda: 2\nAshish Vidyarthi: 3\nVivek Mushran: 2\nRajit Kapoor: 3\n\nDirection Rating: 3\n\nMusic Rating: 3\n\nCinematography: 3\n\nEditing: 3",

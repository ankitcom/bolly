  "review":"A movie with good intensity but not intense enough to amaze. Nevertheless, a good script and marvelous acting by Rajkummar Rao. With few dialogues, it was the director's effort that picked the movie well and kept the consistency going.\n\nStoryline Rating: 3\n\nActing Rating: 4\nRajkummar Rao: 4\n\nDirection Rating: 3\n\nMusic Rating: 2\n\nCinematography: 3\n\nEditing: 2",

  "review":"With more work on revenge script in the later part of the movie, this could have been a wonderfully made thriller. A great build up in first half with some decent direction and amazing acting by Hrithik Roshan, but mostly a disappointment towards the end. Overall, a nice concept and thought, which could've been so much better.\n\nStoryline Rating: 3\n\nActing Rating: 4\nHrithik Roshan: 4\nYami Gautam: 3\nRonit Roy: 2\nRohit Roy: 2\nGirish Kulkarni: 2\nNarendra Jha: 3\nDirection Rating: 3\n\nMusic Rating: 3\n\nCinematography: 3\n\nEditing: 3",

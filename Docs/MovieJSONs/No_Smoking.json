  "review":"This movie is a subject. More you watch, you grow from elementary to reach a Ph.D. level. Every scene is tailor-made and throws some excitement. Anurag Kashyap has made a marvelous script which is directed wonderfully by him. Acting performances are neither a concern here nor a topic of discussion. Amalgamated by excellent situational music by Vishal Bharadwaj, this masterpiece is one of the best Bollywood movies that should be boasted proudly.\n\nStoryline Rating: 5\n\nActing Rating: 3\nJohn Abraham: 3\nAyesha Takia: 3\nParesh Rawal: 4\nRanvir Shorey: 3\n\nDirection Rating: 5\n\nMusic Rating: 4\n\nCinematography: 3\n\nEditing: 5",

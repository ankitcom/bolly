  "review":"Now that's how the variation of intensity should be shown. A perfect blend of harsh and gentle moments where the message is delivered in a wonderfully subtle way. Swara Bhaskar, the wonder woman comes out with another gem of a performance in an another gem of a movie. The lady can certainly pull any kind of role single-handedly. Avinash Das as a first-time writer and director has done a marvellous job.\n\nStoryline Rating: 4\n\nActing Rating: 3\nSwara Bhaskar: 4\nSanjay Mishra: 2\nPankaj Tripathy: 2\n\nDirection Rating: 4\n\nMusic Rating: 2\n\nCinematography: 3\n\nEditing: 4",
